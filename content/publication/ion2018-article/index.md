abstract: "Google released Android Nougat (version 7.0) in 2016, which opens the possibility to use raw data to achieve high precision solutions on low-cost smart devices.  Due to the poor performance of the low-cost antenna and crystal oscillator of smartphone, the accuracy of traditional single point positioning can only reach about 10 meters. The target of this paper is to propose a pseudorange double difference (PDD) with IMU assisted model on smartphone. Real-time difference assisted by IMU positioning algorithm was first applied to realize high-precision positioning on stand-long smartphone platform. Three groups of pedestrian scenes positioning comparison experiments were carried out. The results show that MEMS-based IMU assisted PDD increases smartphone positioning precision and robustness, and the horizonal mean error can be less than 4 meters. It demonstrated that the algorithm can effectively stabilize the performance of smartphone positioning. The significance of this work is to prove that RTD assisted by IMU on low-cost mobile platform is feasible and this algorithm exhibits better performance than traditional positioning solutions."
